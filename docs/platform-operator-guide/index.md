Klutch brings Kubernetes-native, centralized management to data services, allowing platform operators to oversee and
control data service instances within existing Kubernetes (App) clusters, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
With built-in capabilities for provisioning, lifecycle management, and monitoring, Klutch empowers teams to operate data
services at scale while maintaining full control.

In this section, you'll learn how to set up and manage Klutch effectively. Weâ€™ll walk through setting up clusters,
integrating data services, monitoring and updating components, and adding custom data servicesâ€”giving you the knowledge
and confidence to keep your deployments running smoothly. ðŸš€
