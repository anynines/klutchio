Klutch enables central, Kubernetes-native management of data services. Simply put, it adds the
capability “central management of (data) service instances in Kubernetes” to an existing Kubernetes
developer (App) cluster.

Klutch provides Platform Operators with a way to manage infrastructure-agnostic data services that
they can offer on their Kubernetes-based application development platforms. Data service instances
are centrally managed and come with rich life-cycle management and observation capabilities that
make operating data service at scale an easy task while staying in full control.

This section documents the operational tasks required to manage and control data services instance
provisioning for Kubernetes.
