# How to contribute to Klutch

## Contribute bug reports, issues, feature requests

- Ensure the bug/issue/feature request has not already been reported by searching open and closed 
  [GitHub issues](https://github.com/anynines/klutchio/issues?q=is%3Aissue).
- If you're unable to find an issue addressing the problem, 
  [open a new one](https://github.com/anynines/klutchio/issues/new). Be sure to include a title 
  and a clear description, and as much relevant information as possible. If possible, please 
  provide a minimal reproducible example of the bug.

## Contributing code

### General guidelines

- code submissions should include automated tests for the portions of the code that are modified
- Golang changes must pass the automated linting step

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug? 

- Open a PR that includes the issue number of the GitHub issue discussing the bug
- If no issue exists, create one (see above "Reporting a bug" section)

### Do you want to add a feature to Klutch?

- Reach out to the maintainers first using an issue to discuss if the feature is fit for inclusion 
  into Klutch
- If your suggestion gains sufficient traction and approval from the maintainers, go ahead and 
  implement the change
